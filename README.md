## I am from Chicago, IL and I grew up in the Chatham neighborhood and Hammond, IN.
## I am interested in cybersecurity, systems security and digital forensics. My skills are Java and Python programming (though I don't actually like programming) and I'm profiencent in Ubuntu and Kali systems. 
## My first computer (that I can remember) was a Dell Dimension that ran Windows ME. That computer was functional for 7 years then we got another Dell. I like the Dells. Some are hit or miss but for the most part they are reliable computer company.
## I live to travel. So far I have been to Barcelona and Paris and I hope to visit Ireland, Germany and Japan next.
